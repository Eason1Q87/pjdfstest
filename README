pjdfstest is a filesystem test suite that checks various system calls and
POSIX conformance.

This repository is a fork of Tuxera's fork of FreeBSD's pjdfstest.
suite.

Tuxera (of NTFS-3G fame) has a fork[1] of pjdfstest in which they added linux
support and acl tests. It's based on a 2007 version of 'fstest' (renamed to
pjdfstest in 2010) from FreeBSD[2].

Since then, FreeBSD's pjdfstest seems to have added some BSD specific
system calls, a very small number of ACL tests, mknod tests, and tests for
fstat & ftruncate. I'm doing more work on Linux, so for now these changes are
not yet included in this repository (though contributions are welcome).

Installation:
A few notes on how to use pjdfstest:

	$ cd fstest
	$ vi tests/conf
	Change 'fs' to file system type you want to test. These can be:
	UFS, ZFS, ext3, ext4, ntfs-3g, xfs, btrfs, glusterfs.
	$ vi Makefile
	You may need to manually tweak few things by editing CFLAGS lines
	at the top of the file.
	$ make
	It will compile fstest utility which is used by regression tests.
	$ cd /path/to/file/system/you/want/to/test/
	The test must be run as root user.
	$ sudo prove -r /path/to/fstest/

That's all. Enjoy.
